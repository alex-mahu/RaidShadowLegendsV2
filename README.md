# RaidShadowLegendsV2
1. Start Raid Shadow Legends on PC
2. Start RSLCvX.X
3. Set the Click (sec) - leaving it empty will use 10 seconds (Duration is optional but fun, when ending will play the mario growing on collecting a mushroom sound)
4. Click on START
5. Move the mouse to the location where you want to click (you have 5 seconds to get there)
6. Grab a coffee
7. Sip carefully (might be hot)
8. Profit.

Aditional information:
You can SAVE and LOAD settings. Usually the game spawns the window with the same dimension and you can use one of you screen corners as anchors, this way you can save the settings and next time when you start the tool it will load the data from the Settings.json file.

This project is the first phase to learing some kind of UI creation in java. It's not something to be taken as example, but, serve its purpose :).

Hope you like it.

Pretty sure no1 will download it but, hey, just in case, let me know your thoughts about it.
